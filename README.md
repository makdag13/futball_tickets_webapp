This project is focused on developing a simple yet functional website for a football club. The website provides essential information about the club, allows users to book match tickets, and purchase fan merchandise.

Currently, the project is under active development, and a payment integration has not been implemented yet. However, the ticket booking feature is operational, and users receive a confirmation email containing details of their selected game and seating information.

All user-provided data during ticket purchases is securely stored using SQLite and Flask, and the database can be easily managed and viewed through DB Browser.

As this is my first web development project, there are naturally areas for improvement. Nevertheless, it serves as a foundational step in my learning journey and reflects my progress in web development.
